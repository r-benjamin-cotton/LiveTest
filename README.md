## Idea for 360 degree video for VR.

For 360 ° full circle videos, resolution is insufficient even at 2K resolution.
Because it is difficult to raise video resolution from limitations of mobile terminals and network bandwidth
At present, the satisfaction level of VR movies is low.

Then we propose to distort the Equirectangular image and enlarge and record the subject of the content placed in front
Even if the video resolution is low, increase the information volume of the subject.
When playing back, remove the distortion and project the image to increase the resolution in the front and decrease the resolution as going backward.
Although the resolution feeling deteriorates markedly in the lateral direction and the backward direction, even if the resolution is low than it is not seen, it is more realistic to exist.
In this respect it may be more immersive than 180 degrees videos.

Also, by changing the distortion coefficient, you can adjust the balance between the subject and the circumference to some extent
It is also possible to adjust what you want to show according to the content.


In this sample, we used the following video creation script.  
[Unity でステレオ VR 動画を作成する (ほぼ完全 (?) 版)](https://qiita.com/tan-y/items/941de5c8bc3309f835d5)  
So distort the Equirectangular image that is generated by editing the script has been output

I corrected the uv value in CubemapToOtherProjection.shader as follows
```
	float2 opt1 = float2(1.7, 1.5);
	float2 opt2 = float2(2, 2);
	float2 vv = 0.5 / tan(atan(0.5 * opt2) * opt1);
	i_uv = (tan(atan((i_uv - 0.5) * opt2) * opt1)* vv + 0.5) * float2(3.141592 * 2, 3.141592);
```

Movie is recorded in 2k resolution webm format and played on VideoPlayer.
Adjusting the uv value on the sphere model eliminates distortion,
I applied a Gaussian filter to reduce noise, and then applied a sharpening filter similar to an unsharp mask.
